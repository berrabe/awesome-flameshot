So, what kind of script is this?

This shell script, will convert the screenshots taken by the Flameshot program into awesome image. 
This script was built and ported from the Ruby script created by [Bandithijo](https://bandithijo.github.io/blog/memodifikasi-screenshot-dari-flameshot-dengan-imagemagick)

**⚠️ Note : Make sure the [flameshot] (v0.9.0+), [xclip] (0.13+), [colord] (1.4.6+) and [imagemagick] (7.0.11-5+) is already installed on your linux system**

<br/><br/>

### 2 - SETUP

```sh
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berrabe/awesome-flameshot/master/awesome-flameshot
> chmod +x awesome-flameshot
```

<br/>

- and at the top of the script, there is a configuration that you can adjust according to your taste
